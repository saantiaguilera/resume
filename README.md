This is a repo to host the source files of my personal resume.

Running:
- Install MacTeX (or the specific OS tex package)
- Run `make`. Note that since I use mac the make script is only supporting it, if you have a different OS change the `pdflatex` path to the one (check with `which pdflatex` if you need)
